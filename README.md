# They live
##Description
This VR scene shows the number of animals killed for their flesh worldwide in a given number of seconds. It is designed to challenge the immense number of lives taken by humankind from the animal world. The 6 3D models of the animals are displayed by clicking on the button in front of the user, and cycle with each press. For sources and figures, see below.
To explore this scene, you can download all the files on the repository. Then you need to open the "index.html" file in VS Code (or use a local server) and open via go live (live server extension).
